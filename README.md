üí° Future Projects

- MakerPackager
  - Essentially a unified library drawing from existing OpenSCAD enclosure maker scripts
  - [CameronBrooks11/MakerPackager](https://github.com/CameronBrooks11/MakerPackager)
- ChemSCAD
  - Forked from PyPi source based on the paper: [Automatic Generation of 3D-Printed Reactionware for Chemical Synthesis Digitization using ChemSCAD](https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.0c01354) after finding the GitHub source was invalid.
  - In the future will look into incorporating this into the bioreactor ecosystem and making improvements / cleaning up
  - [CameronBrooks11/ChemSCAD](https://github.com/CameronBrooks11/ChemSCAD)
- Fabricatus-Astra
  - A conceptual project intended to combine much of my previous, current and future work in computational engineering and additive manufacturing to create a fully computationally-engineered 3D printable sounding rocket.

‚öôÔ∏è Personal Projects

- KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs
  - Personal fork / continuation of a collection of various schmatics to use as hierarchical design blocks to speed up development in KiCad.
  - Main focus is on expansion of the library, creation of useful PCBs, and integration with the BREAD project
  - [CameronBrooks11/KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs](https://github.com/CameronBrooks11/KiCad-Hierarchical-Designs)
- RPi_Hat_Template
  - Personal fork / continuation of a KiCad design for the Raspberry Pi Hardware Attached on Top (HAT) Specification for use in the BREAD system
  - [CameronBrooks11/RPi_Hat_Template](https://github.com/CameronBrooks11/RPi_Hat_Template)
- PC104-Standard-KiCad
